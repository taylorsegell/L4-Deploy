    "# IBM Data Intelligence Lab: Automating Data Governance and Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **IBM Data Intelligence Lab**! This hands-on experience demonstrates how IBM’s powerful tools—centered around **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog**—can streamline and automate your organization’s data governance workflow from start to finish. By leveraging Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), we’ll guide you through a seamless process to connect, organize, enhance, and share your data, making it ready for business use while ensuring it meets governance standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What’s the Purpose of This Lab?\n",
    "The goal is to show you how APIs—special instructions that let software talk to each other—can automate the entire journey of managing your company’s data. Imagine having a team of digital assistants that handle everything from setting up your workspace to organizing your data files, adding helpful notes, and putting them on a shelf where your colleagues can find them. That’s what we’ll do here, using **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** as the star of the show, with support from **IBM Data Product Hub** and **watsonx.data intelligence Data Lineage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you’ll see how to:\n",
    "- *Set up your workspace*: Configure the environment so **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** knows who you are and where your data lives.\n",
    "- *Connect your data*: Link to places like online storage and databases where your business information is stored.\n",
    "- *Bring in data details*: Import information about your data (called metadata) so **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** can organize it.\n",
    "- *Make your data smarter*: Add extra details to your data to make it more useful and trustworthy.\n",
    "- *Share your data*: Put your improved data on a digital shelf (catalog) for your team to use safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Does This Matter?\n",
    "Data is the lifeblood of modern businesses, but it’s only valuable if it’s well-organized, easy to find, and follows company rules—like privacy policies or quality standards. **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** automates this process, saving time and reducing mistakes. Once your data is ready, **IBM Data Product Hub** can package it for sharing, and **watsonx.data intelligence Data Lineage** can track its history, ensuring transparency and trust across your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You’ll Do in This Lab\n",
    "This lab walks you through six key sections, each building on the last to create a fully automated data governance workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Configuration and Authentication*: Set up your tools and sign into IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CPD) to get started.\n",
    "2. *Connecting Data Sources*: Link **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** to your data storage locations.\n",
    "3. *Bringing Data Details into watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog*: Import metadata to describe your data.\n",
    "4. *Adding Extra Information to Your Data*: Enhance your data with helpful details using **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog**.\n",
    "5. *Waiting for the Extra Details to Finish*: Pause briefly to let the system complete its work.\n",
    "6. *Sharing Your Data with watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog*: Publish your data so it’s available for your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll have a catalog of governed data assets, ready for business analytics, reporting, or sharing through IBM Data Product Hub, with **watsonx.data intelligence Data Lineage** providing visibility into its origins.\n",
    "\n",

    "## How This Lab Works\n",
    "We’ll use a script—a set of instructions written in Python—to tell **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** what to do. The script uses APIs to automate tasks that might otherwise take hours if done manually. For example, instead of typing commands one by one, the script acts like a checklist that **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** follows automatically. You’ll see messages on the screen as each step happens, so you know what’s going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in and see how **watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog** transforms your data into a valuable, governed asset!\n"

    "3. **Running Metadata Enrichment**: This step enhances the imported metadata by adding valuable information, annotations, and classifications. It improves data quality and discoverability.\n",

    "4. **Publishing Enriched Data Assets**: These data assets will be published in our catalog once enriched. This makes them readily available for creating data products and ensures that the enriched information is accessible for future use.\n",

    "This section prepares you for the IBM Data Intelligence Lab by setting up your tools and signing into IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CPD). Think of it as getting your desk ready and logging into a secure system before organizing your company’s data with watsonx.data intelligence Data Governance & Catalog, IBM Data Product Hub, and watsonx.data intelligence Data Lineage.

    "As you can see, this hands-on lab is provided in the form of a <b><i>Jupyter Notebook</i></b>. If you are unfamiliar with this technology, a Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that enables users to create and share documents that contain narrative text, live code, equations, and rich outputs such as graphical visualizations. (Jupyter Notebook is maintained by <a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\">Project Jupyter</a>.) The name <i>Jupyter</i> comes from the core programming languages Jupyter Notebooks support: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which enables users to write programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that Jupyter Notebook supports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook framework contains several menu items and icons that enable users to interact with a notebook. The menu runs along the top of a Notebook just like menus do in other applications; the icons (buttons) are found just below the menu items. This introduction doesn't go into detail about each option available with every menu item. Instead, it will focus on just the two icons you will need to be familiar with to perform the exercises in this lab — these icons/buttons are emphasized in the following illustration:\n",

    "If there are multiple code cells in a Notebook (as there are in this Notebook) and you run the cells in order, imports (external modules that are loaded into an application for use) and variables can be shared across cells. This makes it easy to separate out code into logical chunks without needing to reimport libraries or recreate variables or functions in each cell. (That being said, you will see some variables get recreated in each code cell in this lab — that's done to both reset the variable and to draw your attention to the variables that are used for each operation.) \n",

    "When you select a code cell, you will notice that there are some square braces (<b>[ ]</b>) beside the word <b>In</b> located at the top and just to the left of the cell. As you work your way through the Notebook, the square braces will be filled with a number that indicates the order in which each cell was ran. For example, if you run the first code cell found at the top of a Notebook, the square braces will be filled with the number <b>1</b>. If you run the next code cell found after it, the square braces beside that cell will be filled with the number <b>2</b>, and so on. While a code cell is being executed, the square braces will be filled with an asterisk (<b>*</b>).\n",
