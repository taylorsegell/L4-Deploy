Which of the following responses best positions IBM’s smaller, fit-for-purpose models as the ideal solution?

Remove question Edit question

Correct Answer

Answer A

IBM’s smaller models, such as Granite 13B, cost significantly less to run, potentially saving your business up to $41,000 per month. These savings can be reinvested while still maintaining accuracy and flexibility for your AI tasks.

Answer B

To ensure maximum performance, large models like GPT-4 are the best option for any enterprise AI task. While they have high inferencing costs, the added expense guarantees the best results.

Answer C

IBM’s AI models prioritize cost savings above all else, even if it means a trade-off in accuracy. If keeping expenses low is your top priority, switching to a smaller model is the best choice.

Answer D

Prebuilt, generic AI models from third-party vendors offer the best balance of cost and security. Since they are widely used, they require minimal customization and provide an off-the-shelf solution for any AI task.
